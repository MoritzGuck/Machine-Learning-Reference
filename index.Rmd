# Summary {.unnumbered}

This is a reference for machine learning approaches and methods. The
topics range from math fundamentals to complex machine learning models
and explanation methods. The underlying formulas or mechanisms are provided for each method as
well as code snippets from the respective python libraries. The goal is to give data scientists a 
catalog to find solutions for their current problems, refresh their knowledge and give references for further reading. If you
find errors or unclear explanations in this text, please file an issue
under: `https://github.com/MoritzGuck/Machine-Learning-Reference`.

The currently incomplete sections are marked in grey.
