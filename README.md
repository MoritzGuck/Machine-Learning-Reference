# Machine Learning Reference

## What is this?

This is a reference on applied machine learning for daily use. The topics range from math fundamentals to complex machine learning models and explanation methods. The focus lies on concise explanations and practical code snippets.

It is available at [www.ml-reference.net](https:\ml-reference.net)

## How do I use it?

As an ML engineer or data scientist, you can ...

-   Quickly search and find solutions for your tasks and copy the code snippet into your project.
-   Refresh you knowledge about a topic and find references for further reading.

The currently incomplete sections are marked in grey.

### Compile it yourself

1. Clone the repo and give it a Star. :)

2.  Download R language pack (Suggestion: Download [R-Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/))

3.  Install bookdown-package ([Documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html))

4.  Enter the R Console and use command: `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')`

## I want to get involved 

That's awesome! :smiley: Do you want to:

-   Write/adapt a chapter, section, paragraph?
-   Create figures?
-   Or proofread new chapters?
