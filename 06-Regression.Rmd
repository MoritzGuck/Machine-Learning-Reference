## Gaussian process regression

Gaussian process regression is based on Bayesian Probability: You
generate many models and calculate the probability of your models given
the samples. You make predictions based on the probabilities of your
models.

You get non-linear functions to your data by using non-linear kernels:
You assume that input data points that are similar, will have similar
target values. The concept of similarity (e.g. same hour of the day) is
encoded in the kernels that you use.

left graph shows the prior samples of functions before. These functions
are then conditioned on the data (graph in middle). The right graph
shows the predictions with the credible intervals in gray. *Source:

**Pros:**

-   The model reports the predictions with a certain probability.

-   

**Cons:**

-   Training scales with $O(n^3)$.

-   You need to design or choose a kernel.

``` python
from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import DotProduct, WhiteKernel, RBF, ExpSineSquared
kernel = DotProduct() + WhiteKernel() + RBF() + ExpSineSquared() # The kernel hyperparameters are tuned by the model
gpr = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel)
gpr.fit(X, y)
gpr.predict(X, return_std=True)
```

## Gradient boosted tree regression

Apart from classification, gradient boosted trees also allow for
regression. It works like gradient boosted trees for classification: You
iteratively add decision tree regressors that minimize the regression
loss of the already fitted ensemble. A [decision tree
regressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_tree_regression.html)
is a decision tree that is trained on continuous data instead of
discrete classification data, but its [output is still
discrete](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/regression-trees-decision-tree-for-regression-machine-learning-e4d7525d8047).

``` python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
gbr = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators = 500, min_samples_split =5, max_depth = 4, max_features="sqrt", n_iter_no_change=15)
gbr.fit(X, y)
```

## Time Series Forecasting

For "normal" settings the order of the samples does not play a role
(e.g. blood sugar level of one sample is independent of the others). In
time series however, the samples need to be represented in an ordered
vector or matrix (e.g. The temperature of Jan 2nd is not independent of
the temperature on Jan 1st).

``` python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv", header=0, index_col=0, names=["date", "sales"])
sales_series = df["sales"] # pandas series make working with time series easier 
```

### ARIMA(X) Model

univariate time series model with exogenous regressor.

### VARMMA(X) Model

Multivariate time series model, where the variables can influence each
other and the target can influence the variables and vice versa.
