# Moritz' Machine Learning Reference

This is a reference for machine learning approaches and methods. The topics range from basic statistics to complex machine learning models
and explanation methods. For each method and model, I have provided the underlying formulas (objective functions, prediction functions, etc.) as well as code snippets from the respective python libraries. I am gradually expanding this reference with things that I come across and find worth documenting for later use. If you find errors or unclear explanations in this text, please file an issue under: `https://github.com/MoritzGuck/Machine-Learning-Reference`

References to outside sources are given as direct links to the source for reasons of practicality. 

The compiled book can be found at `http://ml-reference.bplaced.net/`.
