# Summary {.unnumbered}

This is a reference for machine learning approaches and methods. The
topics range from basic statistics to complex machine learning models
and explanation methods. For each method and model, I have provided the
underlying formulas (objective functions, prediction functions, etc.) as
well as code snippets from the respective python libraries. I made this
reference to quickly look up things I have studied already. I published
it to give data scientists a catalog to find methods for their problem,
refresh their knowledge and give references for further reading. If you
find errors or unclear explanations in this text, please file an issue
under: `github.com/MoritzGuck/All_of_ML-under_construction`
